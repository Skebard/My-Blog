This article describes how to use PDO in order to connect with a MySQL database.

According to the PHP manual, "The PHP Data Objects (PDO) defines a lightweight interface for accessing databases in PHP". 
To be clear, PDO is a class from which you can make instances and use those intances to create a connection to your database.


Connections

The PDO connection is creating when instatiating the class. The PDO constructor requieres the data source name (DSN), the username and the password.
The DSN contains the information required to connect to the database

In the following code you can see how we are trying to connect with a database called 'test' that is in our localhost

CODE 1


If the connection fails then a PDOException will be thrown. For this reason when the connection is wrapped in a try/catch.
Now we have succesfully connected to our database. Notice that in the previous example we have connected to an already created database.
If you want to create your database from PHP then in the DNS you do not have to specify the name of the database. Let's see the following example:

CODE2

Once the connection has succeded then we can use the methods provided by the PDO class to perform queries.
The main methods to execute queries from a PDO instance are:
	query(string $statement): execute an SQL statement and allows you to retrieve  the data from  a SELECT statement using the fetch method
        exec(string $statement):  execute an SQL statement but will not let you get the data in case of a SELECT statement
